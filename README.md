To Do List

https://developer.uber.com/earn/ is a good way to earn money</br>
Backend, http://falconframework.org/ looks excellent</br>
I know we wanted to do node.js for the backend but uber provides all kinds of extra help in python so it actually might be easier to use that - we have to jump through some hoops like cors if we use javascript.
