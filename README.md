Notes
<ul>
  <li>You need to use CORS to call from javascript. See timeestimate.js as an example. Before we deploy we have to figure out this: http://blog.ionic.io/handling-cors-issues-in-ionic/</li>
</ul>
Small shit that needs to get done
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/nraboy/ng-cordova-oauth needs to be installed</li>
<li>http://blog.ionic.io/handling-cors-issues-in-ionic/ needs to be installed</li>
<li>Left navigation only works some of the time</li>
<li>Time estimate needs to not set .innerHTML and instead use angular</li>
</ul>

I know we wanted to do node.js for the backend but uber provides all kinds of extra help in python so it actually might be easier to use that - we have to jump through some hoops like cors if we use javascript.
