To Do List
<ul>
  <li>You need to use CORS to call from javascript. See timeestimate.js as an example. Before we deploy we have to figure out this: http://blog.ionic.io/handling-cors-issues-in-ionic/</li>
  <li>In order to login we need to install http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/oauth/</li>

I know we wanted to do node.js for the backend but uber provides all kinds of extra help in python so it actually might be easier to use that - we have to jump through some hoops like cors if we use javascript.
